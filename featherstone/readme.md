# Featherstone

"Rigid Body Dynamics Algorithms" by Roy Featherstone is the textbook that I followed while working on this project.

[Here is a link](https://bcourses.berkeley.edu/files/70847609/download?download_frd=1) to a free PDF of the book. The [jupyter notebook](notes.ipynb) in this folder contains my notes on the book.
