# jax_rbt

This is a JAX implementation of rigid body dynamics algorithms. The goal is to provide a simple, easy to understand implementation of the algorithms described in the textbook "Rigid Body Dynamics Algorithms" by Roy Featherstone.

[Here is a link](https://bcourses.berkeley.edu/files/70847609/download?download_frd=1) to a free PDF of the book. This [jupyter notebook](featherstone/notes.ipynb) contains my notes on the book.
